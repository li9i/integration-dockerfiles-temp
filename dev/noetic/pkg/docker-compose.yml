    # ACTIONS_NEEDED
    # The name of the image consists of two parts.
    # The first is the prefix
    # `registry.gitlab.com/certh-iti-robotics-lab/robetarme/robetarme/ros-noetic-`.
    # The second part should be a unique byte in hexadecimal format.
    # In order to determine it visit:
    # https://www.random.org/cgi-bin/randbyte?nbytes=1&format=h
    # Then make sure no one is using the same id by checking the suffixes of
    # images of the same ROS version at:
    # https://gitlab.com/certh-iti-robotics-lab/robetarme/RoBetArme/container_registry.
    # Then modify line #2 of this file accordingly.

    # ACTIONS_NEEDED
    # The same naming convention applies to the container's name as well.
    # The first part is the prefix
    # `ros_noetic_`. Then the byte id, and at the end `_development_container`.

      # You may communicate between the container and the host via

      # e.g. [shared]-[ros-noetic-92]
      # On the container's side this directory sits at
      # `/home/robetarme_user/shared/`.
      # You should name the former but not the latter.
      # [shared]-[ros-noetic-92] should already exist before running
      # `docker compose build` on the host.
      # You may place the shared directory wherever you like on your host,
      # but if you do so you need to modify the left-hand side of the below mapping.

      # This means that
      # - source code modifications in runtime (in the container) persist on the
      #   host's side: you don't have to port them to the host and then build
      #   the image from scratch
      # - the image already has the source code: you don't need to
      #   `colcon build` upon entry to the container
      # - build/, devel/, and log/ do not overlap between host and container
